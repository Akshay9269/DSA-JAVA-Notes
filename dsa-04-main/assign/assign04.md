1. Implement delAtPos() in Singly circular list.
2. In a singly linear list, implement contains() operation that returns true if given element is present, otherwise returns false. boolean contains(int val).
3. Paperwork: Find time complexities of all operations implemented in singly and circular list.
4. Implement addLast() in doubly linear list.
