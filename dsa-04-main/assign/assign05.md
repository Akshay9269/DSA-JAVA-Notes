1. Implement delLast() operation for doubly linear linked list.
2. Implement following operations for doubly circular linked list.
	a. addAtPos()
	b. delFirst()
	c. delLast()
	d. delAtPos()
3. Implement singly circular list using tail pointer only. Compare time complexities with traditional implementation of singly circular list.
4. Implement stack using singly linear linked list. Time complexity of push() and pop() operation must be O(1).
5. Implement queue using singly linear linked list. Time complexity of push() and pop() operation must be O(1).
6. Sort a singly linear linked list using bubble sort.
