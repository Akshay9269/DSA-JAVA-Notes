# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Agenda
* Introduction to course
* Introduction to Data Structures
* Time and Space complexity
* Searching Algorithms
	* Linear Search
	* Binary Search
* Recursion
	* Recursive Binary Search
* Sorting Algorithms
	* Selection sort

## Time Complexity
* Best Case -- Minimum number of iterations (for given input).
	* Linear Search: Find first element. O(1)
* Worst Case -- Maximum number of iterations (for given input).
	* Linear Search: Find last element or element not found. O(n)
* Average Case -- Average number of iterations (for different random input executing program multiple times).
	* Linear Search: Find element in between. O(n) -- avg iterations n/2. 

## Sorting
* Arranging elements is certain order (ascending or descending).
* Sorting Algorithms
	* Selection sort
	* Bubble sort
	* Insertion sort
	* Quick sort
	* Merge sort
	* Heap sort

### Selection sort
* Select element at an index and compare with all elements after that.
